# Navigation Fix TODO

- [x] Analyze navigation issue (HashRouter conflicting with anchor links)
- [x] Implement smooth scrolling function
- [x] Update navItems structure to include name and id
- [x] Update desktop navigation to use smooth scrolling
- [x] Update mobile navigation to use smooth scrolling
- [x] Test the navigation functionality

## Summary
Fixed navigation by replacing anchor links with smooth scrolling JavaScript, which works properly with HashRouter. Navigation now smoothly scrolls to sections instead of showing partial content.
